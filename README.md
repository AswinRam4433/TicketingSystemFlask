# Ticketing System with Flask
Welcome to TicketingSystemFlask, a RESTful Ticketing System built using Flask.

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary files for the Kaatru Backend Development Assignment. The main component is the rest_py.py file, which serves as the primary Python Flask file running on the Render server.

## Getting Started
To run the Ticketing System locally or on a live server, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Flask installed.

To run the code, use: python rest_py.py

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

## Test Cases

We have included Postman test cases to validate the functionality of the API. The test cases have been exported as JSON and are available in the repository for both local and live server testing.




Looking Forward to hearing from you!
